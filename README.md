# Automation Testing for CMS Website

This repository contains the **automation tests** for the website **cms.pvs-consultancy.com**. The tests are written using the **Selenium WebDriver** framework, with **TestNG** for test management and **ExtentReports** for generating detailed test reports. JSON files are used as **data providers** for running parameterized tests.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating the browser actions.
- **TestNG**: For managing and executing tests.
- **ExtentReports**: For generating visually appealing and detailed test execution reports.
- **JSON**: Used as data providers for parameterized tests.

## Features

- Automated functional and UI tests for CMS Website.
- TestNG framework for structured and organized test execution.
- Extent Reports for detailed test execution reports.
- JSON data providers for parameterized testing.

## Prerequisites

To run the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java** (JDK 8 or higher)
- **Maven** (for dependency management and test execution)
- **Selenium WebDriver** (for browser automation)
- **TestNG** (for test execution)
- **ExtentReports** (for generating test reports)

You also need to have a compatible browser (like Chrome or Firefox) and the corresponding driver (e.g., **chromedriver** or **geckodriver**) installed.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/21a31a4442/test-utils.git
   cd test-utils
2. **Install Dependencies**: The project uses Maven for dependency management. Make sure you have Maven installed, and then run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
Copy
mvn install
```

**Configure WebDriver:**

**Download Browser Driver**: You need to download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser. For example:
- For Chrome, download ChromeDriver from: [ChromeDriver Download](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)
- For Firefox, download GeckoDriver from: [GeckoDriver Download](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
  
**Set the Driver Path**: After downloading the WebDriver, ensure that it is accessible in your system. You can either set the path in the test configuration file, or set the environment variable for the driver.
For example, in your test script, set the WebDriver path like this:

```java
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver");
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
Alternatively, you can add the WebDriver's location to your system environment variables.
```
## Running the Tests with TestNG Suite
The tests are organized and executed using TestNG Suite XML files, which allow you to define which tests to run, the browser to use, and other configurations.

**Step-by-Step Execution**
1. TestNG Suite XML Configuration: In the repository, you'll find TestNG XML suite files (e.g., testng.xml). These XML files define the test suite, which consists of multiple test classes and configurations. Here's a basic example of what the XML file might look like:

```xml
Copy
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<suite name="CMS Automation Suite">
    <test name="Login Test">
        <classes>
            <class name="com.test.LoginTest" />
            <class name="com.test.ProductTest" />
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>
```
This configuration will run the LoginTest and ProductTest classes. You can define multiple tests and classes as needed.

2. Running Tests Using Maven: You can run the TestNG suite using the following Maven command:

```bash
Copy
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
```
This will execute the tests defined in the testng.xml file.

**Running Tests Using IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ):** If you're using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:

* Right-click the testng.xml file in your project.
* Select Run As > TestNG Suite.

## Test Reports
Test reports are automatically generated by ExtentReports and saved in the reports folder. After test execution, open the respective report html file located in the reports folder to view the detailed test execution report, including pass/fail status, screenshots (if included), and logs.
